My very own Azure resume

<b>Hello Marc</b>

Created the js code for the counter on resume. 
Deleted all Azure resources, recreated the cosmosdb account and left it at that.

Updated resume info to match final draft

Time to build backend!

CosmosDB account configured

Azure linked to Visual Studio Code

Created GetCount.cs

Tested Function and is working!
